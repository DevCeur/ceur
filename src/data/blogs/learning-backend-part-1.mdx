    This is like a story with some of code,{" "}
    <strong>this is not a tutorial</strong>, but you can also learn some of the
    things I talk on the post, chill, read and enjoy this journey with me.

  Why learn Backend?
</Heading>

<Text mb={12}>
  Well, more than just be a Full Stack, I want to have the ability to help at my
  entire team or at least understand better why they do some of the things that
  they do as Backend developers.

<Heading as="h2" mb={6}>
  Databases, servers, models, WTF?
</Heading>

<Text mb={12}>
  I had some of knowledge on those topics, I knew a brief concept of what a{" "}
  <code className="inline">database</code> can be, what's a model, but, how the
  hell could I use it? So as a first step, I started searching types of
  databases, and I found that there's two types,{" "}
  <code className="inline">relationals</code> and{" "}
  <code className="inline">no relationals</code> or{" "}
  <code className="inline">SQL</code> and <code className="inline">NoSQL</code>.
  So I wanted to know the main difference between those types, and that was{" "}
  <strong>the way they store the data.</strong> For the{" "}
  <code className="inline">SQL</code> databases, they store the data on{" "}
  <strong>tables</strong> &#40;think on it as an spread sheet if you want&#41;
  and the <code className="inline">NoSQL</code> databases store the data on{" "}
  <strong>documents</strong> &#40;If you work with{" "}
  <code className="inline">JSON</code> think on it like an
  JSON-Object-like&#41;.

<Text mb={12}>
  At this point, I discovered that in some point I worked with{" "}
  <Link href="https://firebase.google.com" isExternal color="yellow.500">
    Firebase
  </Link>{" "}
  and I just realized that I was using with a{" "}
  <code className="inline">NoSQL</code> database when I worked with{" "}
  <code className="inline">Firestore</code>. But I wanted to try relationals
  databases and I knew that on my job the backend side used{" "}
  <strong>PostgresQL</strong> as his main <strong>database system</strong>. So I
  researched a little bit and I discovered that there's a query language called{" "}
  <strong>SQL</strong> that means <strong>S</strong>tructured <strong>Q</strong>
  uery <strong>L</strong>anguage.

  So, this is not a technical post, but, if you want to install Postgres, you

  So, I already have a Database system, now, I need to choose a stack to work
  with no? Well, At this point I thinked, "You already know Javascript, and
  Node, so...", <strong>There you go!</strong>

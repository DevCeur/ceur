<Text mb={12}>
  Well, this is something that in some point of my young Frontend career I
  wanted to build, <strong>My Own Blog</strong>. And now I'm here, writing my
  first blog, in my own website, created with code writed by me, and yeah, this
  maybe sounds simple, but this is very important, and powerfull for me.

<Heading mb={2}>How I started?</Heading>

<Text mb={4}>First, It was a dream, later just a little bit of reality.</Text>

```js
import React from "react";
import useSWR from "swr";
import format from "comma-number";

import fetcher from "../../lib/fetcher";

import MetricCard from "./card";

function Unsplash() {
  const { data } = useSWR("/api/unsplash", fetcher);

  const downloads = format(data?.downloads);
  const views = format(data?.views);
  const link = "https://unsplash.com/@leerob";

  return (
    <>
      <MetricCard header="Unsplash Downloads" link={link} metric={downloads} />
      <MetricCard header="Unsplash Views" link={link} metric={views} />
    </>
  );
}

export default Unsplash;
```

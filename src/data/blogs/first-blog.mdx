<Text mb={12}>
  Well, this is something that in some point of my young Frontend career I
  wanted to build, <strong>My Own Blog</strong>. And now I'm here, writing my
  first blog, in my own website, created with code writed by me, and yeah, this
  maybe sounds simple, but this is very important, and powerfull for me.

  How I started?
</Heading>

<Text mb={8}>First, It was a dream, later just a little bit of reality.</Text>

```jsx:pages/home.tsx
import React from "react";

const HelloBlog() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello Blog</h1>
    </div>
  );
}

export default HelloBlog;
```

<VStack align="flex-start" mt={8} spacing={8} mb={12}>

    Literally that was my first file and my first component when I wanted to build
    my own blog. maybe one year and a half ago I think. That was the start of this
    journey of learning, disapointments, more learning and code, and my first job
    as a Frontend developer! I'm writing something about that BTW...
  </Text>

  <Text>
    I just wanted a place to keep safe my thoughts and my knowledge, to share
    things I know and to have a little <i>"terrain"</i> on the internet. To learn
    more, about writing and how the people like to learn and read things like
    this. <code class="inline">hello world</code>
  </Text>
</VStack>

<VStack align="flex-start" mt={8} spacing={8} mb={12}>
  <Heading as="h2">What's the plan?</Heading>
  <Box>
    <OrderedList spacing={4}>
      <ListItem>Write, write, write...</ListItem>
      <ListItem>Improve this blog and the website monthly</ListItem>
      <ListItem>
        Make at least <strong>1 new article</strong> per month.
      </ListItem>
    </OrderedList>
